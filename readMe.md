It relies heavily on javascript’s ‘mouseenter’ and ‘mouseleave’ events to drive the interactive experience. Hopefully the alternating light and dark color of the squares in the playing area creates a flashlight kind of look. 

	To begin play simply click on the button labeled ‘click here to get your flashlight and enter the mine’. The game area shows and the yellow ‘circle’ of the flashlight beam appears. Carefully search for the mushroom, and click on it. Each mushroom gives you one point. Clicking the mushroom ends the level. Click on the button labeled ‘click here to continue’ to go to the next level.

	Starting at the second level a rat is randomly placed in the game area. Each level after the second adds one more rat. There’s also a pause programmed into the game when you scroll over the rats. As you progress in levels the pause decreases until it’s roughly 1/5 of a second. If you let your ‘flashlight’ linger too long on the rats they’ll attack you and take a hit point. You only have 10 hit points, so be wary.
